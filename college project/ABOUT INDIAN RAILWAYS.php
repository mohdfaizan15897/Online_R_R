  The first railway on Indian sub-continent ran over a stretch of 21 miles from Bombay to Thane. The idea of a railway to connect Bombay with Thane,
<BR>
Kalyan and with the Thal and Bhore Ghats inclines first occurred to Mr. George Clark, the Chief Engineer of the Bombay Government, during a visit.
<BR>
 to Bhandup in 1843.
<BR>
 The formal inauguration ceremony was performed on 16th April 1853, when 14 railway carriages carrying about 400 guests left Bori Bunder at 3.30 pm
<BR>
"amidst the loud applause of a vast multitude and to the salute of 21 guns." The first passenger train steamed out of Howrah station destined for
<BR>
 Hooghly, a distance of 24 miles, on 15th August, 1854. Thus the first section of the East Indian Railway was opened to public traffic, inaugurating<BR>the beginning of railway transport on the Eastern side of the sub-continent.
<BR>
 In south the first line was opened on Ist July, 1856 by the Madras Railway Company. It ran between Vyasarpadi Jeeva Nilayam (Veyasarpandy) and
<BR>
Walajah Road (Arcot), a distance of 63 miles. In the North a length of 119 miles of line was laid from Allahabad to Kanpur on 3rd March 1859. The
<BR>
first section from Hathras Road to Mathura Cantonment was opened to traffic on 19th October, 1875.
<BR>
 These were the small beginnings which is due course developed into a network of railway lines all over the country. By1880 the Indian Railway
<BR>
system had a route mileage of about 9000 miles. INDIAN RAILWAYS, the premier transport organization of the country is the largest rail network in<BR>Asia and the world's second largest under one management.

Territorial Readjustment of Zones and In-House Reforms<BR>
In order to bring about greater efficiency in administration, speedy implementation of on-going projects, better customer care, reduction of <BR>
workload on General Managers etc., Indian Railways have decided to create seven new zones by territorial re-adjustment of existing zones. The new<BR>
zones, having limited financial burden on Railways, will have thin and lean, efficient and modern administrative set up. Two of the new zones have<BR>
already started functioning.<BR><BR>

National Rail Vikas Yojana<BR><BR>

With a view to complete strategically important projects within a stipulated period of time, a non-budgetary investment initiative for the<BR>
development of Railways has been launched.. Under the scheme all the capacity bottlenecks in the critical sections of the railway network will<BR>
be removed at an investment of Rs.15,000 crore over the next five years. These projects would include:<BR>

1.Strengthening of the golden Quadrilateral to run more long-distance mail/express and freight trains at a higher speed of 100 kmph.<BR>
2.Strengthening of rail connectivity to ports and development of multi-modal corridors to hinterland.<BR>
3.Construction of four mega bridges - two over River Ganga, one over River Brahmaputra, and one over River Kosi.<BR>
4.Accelerated completion of those projects nearing completion and other important projects.<BR><BR>

New Steps towards Safety and Security :<BR><BR>

Safety of 13 million passengers that Indian Railways serve every day is of paramount importance to the system. Over the years, apart from the<BR>
regular safety norms followed, the network has taken a number of steps through innovative use of technology and stepped up training to its manpower<BR>
to enhance safety standards. Constitution of Rs.17,000 crore non-lapsable Special Railway Safety Fund (SRSF) to replace the arrears of aging assets<BR>
of Railways over the next six years has been a historical move in this direction. A number of distressed bridges, old tracks, signalling system and<BR>
other safety enhancement devices will be replaced during this period. As far as budget allocation for safety is concerned, Rs.1,400 crore was<BR>
allocated in the revised estimate for the year 2001-02 and Rs.2,210 crore for the year 2002-2003. Extensive field trials of the Anti-Collision<BR>
Device (ACD), indigenously developed by Konkan Railway, is going on and once deployed across the Zonal Railways, this innovative technology will<BR>
help railways reduce accidents due to collision between trains.<BR><BR>

Security of railway passengers is at present a shared responsibility of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Reserve Police (GRP).<BR>
Efforts are on to amend the Railway Act to give more powers to the RPF in ensuring security of passengers on trains and within Railway premises.<BR>
Deployment of women police Force has been made for security and assistance of women passengers.<BR><BR>



A pilot project for issuing monthly and quarterly season tickets through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) has been launched in Mumbai this year<BR>
and has been found very successful. Another pilot project for purchasing tickets including<B> monthly and quarterly season tickets</B> through Smart Card<BR>
has also been launched.<BR><BR>

<B>"National Train Enquiry System"</B> has been started in order to provide upgraded passenger information and enquiries. This system provides the train<BR>
running position on a current basis through various output devices such as terminals in the station enquiries and Interactive Voice Response<BR>
System (IVRS) at important railway stations. So far the project has been implemented at 98 stations.<BR><BR
<B>Freight Operations Information System (FOIS)</B> Computerisation of freight operations by Railways has been achieved by implementing Rake Management<BR>
System (RMS). Such FOIS terminals are available at 235 locations<BR><BR>   Railways have established their own intra-net 'Railnet' It provides networking between Railway Board, Zonal Headquarters, Divisional headquarters,<BR>
Production Units, Training Centers etc.<BR><BR><B>Sterling Performance by PSUs</B> The public sector undertakings of the Railways, especially IRCON and RITES, scored commendable achievements</BR>
during the last three years. IRCON International has achieved a record turnover of Rs.900 crore during 2001-02 and the foreign exchange earnings</BR>of this prestigious organization has increased six fold over the years. At the international level, IRCON is at present executing different<BR>projects in Malaysia, Bangladesh and Indonesia. The PSU has registered a strong presence in the international scenario by its sterling track<BR>
record.<BR><BR><B>RITES,</B> another prestigious PSU under the Ministry has scaled new heights in performance, profit and dividend to the shareholders during the<BR>
last three years. Its turn over increased from Rs.172 crore in 1999 to Rs.283 crore in 2002. RITES for its sterling performance secured the<BR> prestigious ISO-9001 Certification this year. The company has also entered into export/leasing of locomotives in different countries in Asia and<BR> Africa. RITES is operating all over the world including Columbia, UK, Iran, Malayasia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia,<BR>
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.<BR>
<BR>Indian Railways Finance Corporation Limited secured excellent rating for fourth year in succession by the Department of Public enterprises on the<BR>basis of the performance targets. Besides, Standards and Poor's, the international credit rating agency, also reaffirmed the sovereign ratings to<BR>
IRFC. The Corporation has been making profits and paying dividends.<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><B>Source :</B>Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) CMS Team Last Reviewed on: 07-02-2011</CENTER>
